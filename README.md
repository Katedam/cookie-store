# Pat's Coffee and Cookies

Pat needs a website and web application to promote her Coffee & Cookie shops, of which she has 5 locations. She needs a cookie counter to keep track of how many cookies customers are buying per hour at each location so that she can pass this info on to her production team. Additionaly she needs a logo that can be used on merch and to promote her winning duo of coffee and salmon cookies.
